    <div class="about-text">
      It's easy to lose track of how long your laundry's been running - and
      sometimes the estimated time remaining on the machines is even
      <i>wrong</i>. Additionally, all machines may be in use, causing students
      to take extra trips to the laundry room just to see if a machine is
      available.
      <p></p>
      Our solution: A monitoring setup that connects to the laundry machines in
      university dorms in order to keep track of machines being used, along with
      their current status. Students will be able to access this information
      through a mobile app that displays simple information about time remaining
      for all machines and their availability.
