    It's easy to lose track of how long your laundry's been running - and sometimes the estimated time remaining on the
    machines is even <i>wrong</i>. Additionally, all machines may be in use, causing students to take extra trips to the
    laundry room just to see if a machine is available.
    <p></p>
    Our solution: A monitoring setup that connects to the laundry machines in university dorms in order to keep track of
    machines being used, along with their current status. Students will be able to access this information through a
    mobile app that displays
    simple
    information about time remaining for all machines and their availability.

    The setup so far is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plugs connected to the WiFi in the residence halls (not eduroam!) - specifically,
        models that support the "emeter" power monitoring system with <a
          href="https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-kasa</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        One or more Raspberry Pis (or other dedicated server hardware) also connected to the residential LAN,
        which will be instructed to connect to the smart plugs and send their data to an MQTT server.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mobile app that fetches the data posted by the Raspberry Pis from the previously mentioned MQTT server
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
